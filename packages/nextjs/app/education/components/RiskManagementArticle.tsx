            Risk management is a crucial aspect of automated trading strategies. Most investors will prefer a lower risk
            strategy with less profits that also reduces potential drawdowns. Strategies can still be successful without
            stop-losses or other risk-management techniques, but the risk of losses can be far greater.
          </p>
          <h5>Here&rsquo;s a basic overview of some concepts to be aware of:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Position Sizing:</strong> This involves determining how much capital to allocate to each trade. A
              common approach is to risk only a small percentage (often 1-2%) of your total trading capital on any
              single trade. This helps ensure that a string of losses won&rsquo;t deplete your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stop-Loss Orders:</strong> These are predetermined price points at which a trade will be
              automatically closed to limit potential losses. Stop-losses can be set based on a fixed price, a
              percentage move, or more complex criteria like volatility measures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Diversification:</strong> Spreading risk across different assets, markets, or strategies can help
              mitigate the impact of poor performance in any single area. This could involve trading multiple currency
              pairs in forex or using different strategies for different market conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Leverage Control:</strong> If your strategy uses leverage, note that while it can amplify profits,
              it also magnifies losses. Setting strict limits on leverage use is essential to prevent catastrophic
              losses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monitoring and Adjustment:</strong> Regularly reviewing strategy performance and market conditions
              is crucial. This might involve implementing &ldquo;circuit breakers&rdquo; that pause trading during
              extreme market volatility or adjusting parameters based on changing market dynamics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Overall Portfolio Risk:</strong> Beyond individual trade risk, it&rsquo;s important to manage risk
              at the portfolio level. This could involve setting maximum drawdown limits or using correlation analysis
              to ensure your strategies aren&rsquo;t all exposed to the same risks.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By implementing these risk management techniques, traders aim to preserve capital during inevitable losing
            streaks and ensure the longevity of their trading operations. Remember, the goal is not just to maximize
            returns, but to do so in a way that&rsquo;s sustainable over the long term.
